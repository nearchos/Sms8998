# Sms8998

A simple app that helps you form and send an SMS to 8998 in line with Cyprus' Ministry of Health measures against the spread of Covid-19.

The app has built-in support for Greek ![Image of Greek flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nearchos/Sms8998/main/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/el.png) and English ![Image of US & UK flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nearchos/Sms8998/main/app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/en.png). You can easily switch between the two regardless of the language settings of your device.

## FAQ
- Why isn't it available on Google Play?

Because releasing Covid-19 related apps on Google Play is a bit complicated as a result of its [policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9889712) - which I understand.
- As the app is not on Google Play is it safe to use?

Personally I think this is one of the safest apps that exist for the following two reasons: First, it's an open source app so you can view its code and verify it's safe. Second, you can easily verify by looking at the code that it doesn't communicate any info over the Web (except via the SMS to 8998). As such, it's one of very few apps which does not even require the [INTERNET persmission](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting).
