## FAQ
- Why isn't it available on Google Play?

Because releasing Covid-19 related apps on Google Play is a bit complicated as a result of this [policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9889712) - which is reasonable and acceptable.

- As the app is not on Google Play is it safe to use?

It can be argued that this is one of the safest apps that exist for the following two reasons: First, it's an open source app so you can view its code and verify it's safe. You are even encouraged to build it and install it on your own. Second, you can easily verify by looking at the code that it doesn't communicate any info over the Web (except via the SMS to 8998). As such, it's one of very few apps which does not even require the [INTERNET permission](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting). Notably, it doesn't even use any form of analytics to track its usage. So after installing it, its use is not (and cannot be) traced by anyone.
